        "There is no guarantee of liquidity or market price of any Digital Currency at any extent at any time. At any given time in transacting, there may be limited or no liquidity in the ability to buy and/or sell digital currencies to effectuate transactions. The Protocol bears no responsibility for this lack of liquidity in any of its functional Digital Currencies traded on its platform. Liquidity refers to the extent to which a market allows assets to be bought and sold at stable prices. Lower liquidity tends to result in a more volatile market (especially when large orders are placed), and it causes prices to change more drastically; whereas higher liquidity creates a less volatile market, and prices do not fluctuate as significantly. The Protocol cannot guarantee that there will be any demand or market for any digital currencies allowed to be traded on its platform.",

        "Any one or all of our exchange partners may at any time freeze or temporarily suspend access to User funds in accounts because of Know-Your-Customer requirements or other nefarious activities, law enforcement, etc.",

        "Regulation of digital currency platforms in Britisih Virgin Islands (BVI) or worldwide, and/or regulation of digital swap platforms in BVI or worldwide, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of any of the digital currencies bought or sold using EGSpectre, whether it is justified.",

        "The Protocol may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Protocol’s infrastructure network, and/or the Protocol’s platform.",

        "The Protocol is not able to anticipate occurrences of hacks, cyberattacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in EGSpectre, the smart contracts on which the Protocol relies on, or on the Ethereum blockchain, or on any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Protocol may not be able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors, vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.",

        "The Protocol may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to Protocol and/or holders of all Digital Currencies. Any significant breach of Protocol security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability, and security of EGSpectre may adversely affect the ability of uses to buy and sell Digital Currencies.",

        "The Protocol is dependent in part on the location and data center facilities of third parties. The Protocol’s current infrastructure network is in part established through servers which are housed at the location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If the Protocol is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, Protocol may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Any such security breaches or damages which occur which impact upon Protocol’s infrastructure network and/or the EGSpectre may adversely impact the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.",

        "Suppliers on which the Protocol relies for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the Protocol operations or expenses. There can be",

        "no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on Protocol’s business, financial condition, and results of operations and hence the EGSpectre and/or ability to structure, license and launch the EGSpectre future business lines. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the trading price of any of the digital currencies. The Protocol or any of the functional digital currencies allowed to be bought or sold through the Protocol may be affected by newly implemented regulations.",

        "Buying or selling Digital Currency is generally unregulated worldwide and highly uncertain, while numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have considered implementing regulatory regimes which govern Digital Currency or Digital Currency markets. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the trading price of any of the digital currencies. The Protocol or any of the functional digital currencies allowed to be bought or sold through the Protocol may be affected by newly implemented regulations."
